## back in the day ##

When "computer" meant a unix workstation on a campus network, one could personalize an account in ways visible to others on the network.

## finger ##

The finger protocol would allow one - knowing a person's username - to ask the network to report some details about that account.
The output of "finger X" would look something like this:

## .plan ##

If you added a text file called `.plan` into your home directory, then what was contained in that file would be visible to others when they `finger X` your account.

The gentleman above had no `.plan`, so it says *No Plan.*

I, on the otherhand, had a script that replaced the contents of my `.plan` file every time I logged in.  My `.plan` would rotate among a couple hundred different pithy texts, mostly culled from newsgroup conversations.

## to the web and beyond ##

Naturally, these hundred pithy texts became fodder for the World Wide Web when it was finally invented, and they continue to live on here.

Lucky you.
